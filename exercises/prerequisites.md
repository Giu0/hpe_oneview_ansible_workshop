# Prerequisites

This workshop will need following prerequisites:

## VMs needed
Following virtual machines need to be available
- OneView VM 
  I'd love to see this installed already.

- Ansible Tower VM
  10 GB Mem
  250 GB HDD
  4 vCPUs
  RHEL ISO image 
  Networking
  We will install RHEL 8.2 or newer jointly, if not done already

- Bastion Host VM
  4 GB Mem (2 wÃ¼rden auch reichen)
  100 GB HDD
  2 vCPUs
  RHEL ISO image 
  Networking
  We will install RHEL 8.2 or newer jointly, if not done already

## Installation target needed
Additionaly we need a HPE Gen 10 Server which can be deployed onto.


## RHEL ISO image needed
We did not automate the RHEL installation process so please choose the following when installing manualy:

Fetch an RHEL installation image from:
https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux => Login => Downloard RHEL 8.4 => 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Binary DVD

Hint: you can copy the Link from the "Downlad Now" button and paste it directly into the download cmd / system which needs to have the ISO at the end.
E.g. download directly onto your ESXi server or a repository server in your location.

## RHEL installation
Boot from ISO image downloaded previously
